This is the API documentation for PCMSolver API. 
PCMSolver is an API for solving the Polarizable Continuum Model electrostatic problem \cite Tomasi2005

With PCMSolver we aim to:

1. provide a plug-and-play library for adding the PCM functionality to *any* quantum chemistry program;

2. create a playground for easily extending the implementation of the model.
